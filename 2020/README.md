# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2020 (https://adventofcode.com/). I will try to keep a naming scheme like `[day]_[no].prolog` so e.g. `1_1.prolog` will be the first riddle of the first day. Please be fair and do not look at solutions to riddles you have not solved yourself.

## Execution

You can either load and execute each riddle individually in prolog or just run `solveAll.sh` which will solve all riddles in the repository in ascending order.

Either way you will need a prolog interpreter (e.g. swi-prolog).

## Choice of Programming Language

I will try to solve all of the riddles in Prolog, although I have no experience in Prolog at all. I only had one introduction into Prolog ~15 years ago, so probably anybody who has experience in Prolog will probably bang his head against the wall when he sees my solutions. ;)

Nevertheless I choose Prolog because I like the idea of describing the problem rather than inventing an algorithm that solves the problem and I think it could be used quite efficiently to solve such riddle.
